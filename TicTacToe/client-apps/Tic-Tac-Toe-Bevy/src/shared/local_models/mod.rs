//  Tic-Tac-Toe Bevy Client App

// This module contains the local, Bevy-client-specific renditions of the TicTacToe client SDK's
// local_models. It seems to be redundant. But, we don't want the major body of the app tied
// directly to the SDK's models. These local models and the ServiceClient provide us with the
// requisite abstraction layer.
