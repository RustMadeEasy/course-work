# Tic-Tac-Toe Swift Client App

## Description

A Tic-Tac-Toe client app written in Swift. This app runs on macOS and iOS.

_NOTE: This sample code is part of the RustMadeEasy.com courses and is not meant for use in
production._

Roadmap:

1. Resilient communication with the service - retries, etc.
2. Option to replay the game once it has ended - using the Tic-Tac-Toe service's Game History endpoint.
3. Tell local player when the other player has abandoned the game.
