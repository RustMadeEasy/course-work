# Source Code for the Rust Made Easy Courses 

## Description

The purpose of Rust Made Easy is to help engineers overcome the steep learning curve often attributed to Rust.

### What Is Rust?

Rust is a programming language designed to mitigate several classes of programming errors often encountered in C and C++ 
programming.

Per Wikipedia:

"Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory. It does so without a traditional garbage collector; instead, both memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the "borrow checker", which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time."
